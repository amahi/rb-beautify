# rb-beautify - Ruby Beautifier

Trying to keep this old guy (from way back) up to date.

It will format ruby files to make them look good indentation wise and etc. It's kind of like go format, but for ruby (though it does not parse the program in).

If you find some code that this beautifier cannot handle, please send it our way by way of a bug or better yet a pull request.
